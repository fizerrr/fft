# FFT Algorithm in C++
This project contains a C++ implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The FFT algorithm is a widely used technique for efficient computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and has applications in signal processing, image processing, and data compression.
